		ScreenGrab is designed for the Windows operating system.  <br /> <br />
		At this time there is not a build for MacOS or Linux. <br /> <br />
		Pining ScreenGrab to your taskbar and enabling it as a startup application is recommended for the best experience. <br /> <br />
		ScreenGrab is deployed with a MSI installer. When an update to the app is pushed it is not automatically installed on to your device. <br /> <br />
